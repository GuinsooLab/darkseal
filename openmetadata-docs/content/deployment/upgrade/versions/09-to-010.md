# Upgrade from 0.9 to 0.10

**The 0.10 Release consists of backward-incompatible changes. We do not support database migration from the 0.9.0 release.
Please follow the steps carefully and backup your database before proceeding. 0.10.0 installations require brand new
installation, and we have a migration tool to transfer all your entity descriptions, tags, owners, etc. to the 0.10.0
release**

Please reach out to us on [Slack](https://slack.open-metadata.org), we can schedule a zoom session to help you upgrade your
production instance.

## Requirements

Update the `openmetadata-ingestion` client to the latest available version.

Make sure that you [backed up](/deployment/upgrade/backup-metadata) your metadata.

<Note>

To migrate the metadata from the 0.9 to the 0.10 version you need to ingest all the connectors in the 0.10 version with
the same service name as done in the 0.9 version. For example, if you have ingested snowflake connector in 0.9 version
with service name `Snowflake_Prod` then in the 0.10 version, you need to ingest the snowflake connector again with the
name `Snowflake_Prod`.

</Note>

## Metadata Migration

All connectors are now defined as JSON Schemas. [Here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/catalog-rest-service/src/main/resources/json/schema/entity/services/connections/metadata/openMetadataConnection.json)
you can find the structure to create a connection to Snowflake. In order to create and run a Metadata Ingestion workflow,
we will follow the steps to create a YAML configuration able to connect to the source, process the Entities if needed, 
and reach the OpenMetadata server. The workflow is modeled around the following [JSON Schema](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/catalog-rest-service/src/main/resources/json/schema/metadataIngestion/workflow.json).

## 1. Setup your 0.10.1 installation

1. OpenMetadata 0.9, keep it running as it is with its own MySQL and ES
2. Install OpenMetadata 0.10.1, make it completely isolated from your 0.9 install new MySQL DB and other ES indexes
3. Install 0.10.1 connectors
4. Run ingestion of all your entities using the new connector. Keep the service names the same as your 0.9
   installations. Once all the entities are ingested into OpenMetadata 0.10.1. For example, if you have ingested
   snowflake connector in 0.9 version with service name Snowflake_Prod then in the 0.10 version, you need to ingest the
   snowflake connector again with the name `Snowflake_Prod`.
5. Run migration using the newly installed connector

## 2. Define the YAML Config

This is a sample config:

```yaml
source:
  type: migrate
  serviceName: local_metadata
  serviceConnection:
    config:
      type: OpenMetadata
      hostPort: http://<hostport of 0.9.0 Openmetadata Server>/api
      authProvider: no-auth
      includeTables: true
      includeUsers: true
      includeTopics: true
      includePipelines: true
      includeTags: true
      includeGlossaryTerms: true
      includeMessagingServices: true
      includeDatabaseServices: true
      includePipelineServices: true
      enableVersionValidation: false
      limitRecords: 100000
  sourceConfig:
    config:
      enableDataProfiler: false
stage:
  type: migrate
  config:
    dirPath: <Directory Path to store data>
bulkSink:
  type: migrate
  config:
    dirPath: <Directory Path to store data>
workflowConfig:
  openMetadataServerConfig:
    hostPort: http://<hostport of 0.10.x Openmetadata Server>/api
    authProvider: no-auth
```

### Source Configuration - Service Connection

You can find all the definitions and types for the `serviceConnection` [here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/catalog-rest-service/src/main/resources/json/schema/entity/services/connections/database/clickhouseConnection.json). 
- `hostPort`: Enter the OpenMetadata 0.9 Server Config. Must include API end point ex: `http://localhost:8585/api`
- `includeTables`: Include tables for migration
- `includeUsers`: Include users for migration 
- `includeTopics`: Include topics for migration
- `includePipelines`: Include pipelines for migration 
- `includeGlossaryTerms`: include glossary terms for migration
- `includeTags`: Include tags for migration. 
- `includeMessagingServices`: Include messaging services for migration.
- `includeDatabaseServices`: Include database services for migration.
- `enableVersionValidation`: Enable the server OpenMetadata and client OpenMetadata version validation. For migrating the metadata this has to be set to `false`
- `limitRecords`: Limit the number records that is fetched by 0.9 OpenMetadata API (1 to 1000000, default = 10).

### Stage Configuration

```yaml
stage:
  type: migrate
  config:
    dirPath: <Directory Path to store data>
```

The data while migrating from the 0.9 to 0.10 version needs to be stored in a file directory. in the dir Path field
enter a valid file directory path to store the metadata.

### BulkSink Configuration

```yaml
bulkSink:
  type: migrate
  config:
    dirPath: <Directory Path to store data>
```

The `dirPath` needs to be set as the same passed in stage config, which contains the file directory path where the
metadata is stored.

### Workflow Configuration

The main property here is the `openMetadataServerConfig`, where you can define the host and security provider of your
OpenMetadata installation. 

For a simple, local installation using our docker containers, this looks like:

```yaml
workflowConfig:
  openMetadataServerConfig:
    hostPort: http://<hostport of 0.10.x Openmetadata Server>/api
    authProvider: no-auth
```

<Note>

In `openMetadataServerConfig` you need to pass details about the 0.10 OpenMetadata Server.

</Note>

## 3. Run with the CLI

First, we will need to save the YAML file. Afterward, and with all requirements installed, we can run:

```commandline
metadata ingest -c <path-to-yaml>
```
