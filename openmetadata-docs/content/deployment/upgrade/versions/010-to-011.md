# Upgrade from 0.10 to 0.11

Upgrading from 0.10 to 0.11 can be done directly on your instances. This page will list a couple of details that you
should take into consideration when running the upgrade.

## Highlights

### Data Indexing

0.11 comes with changes to the Elasticsearch indexes. In this case, indexes will need to be recreated.
You can do so by following this guide: [How to fully index OpenMetadata into Elasticsearch](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/discussions/5300).

### Ingestion Pipelines

The process of how the Ingestion Pipelines retrieve the service data has been updated. During the upgrade, your services
will be automatically updated if their schema changed, and the Ingestion Pipelines will be removed. 

From the `Services > Ingestion` tab, you can then re-create and deploy the Ingestion Pipelines.

### Clear the Cache!

Are you having some issues with the UI after upgrading to 0.11? Make sure you clean the browser cache to pick up all the
updated components and definitions properly.

### Metadata Workflow Updates

In the 0.11.0 release, we moved around a couple of things from the metadata ingestion workflow, specifically in the
`sourceConfig`:

- `generateSampleData`: this now happens on the profiler workflow. This option is removed from the metadata pipeline
- `sampleDataQuery` is not needed anymore, as in the profiler workflow, we use real automated sampling 
- `enableDataProfiler` is part of profiler workflow. As running the profiler takes a longer time, we moved the profiler into a separate ingestion
    workflow. This way, one can schedule the metadata extraction workflows to be more frequent and get the latest metadata.
    Please refer to the examples here to schedule a profiler [workflow](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/ingestion/examples/workflows/redshift_profiler.yaml).
