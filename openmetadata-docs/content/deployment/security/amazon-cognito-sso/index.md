## Configure Ingestion

The ingestion can be configured by [Enabling JWT Tokens](/deployment/security/enable-jwt-tokens).

When setting up the YAML config for the connector, update the `workflowConfig` as follows:

```yaml
workflowConfig:
  openMetadataServerConfig:
    hostPort: http://localhost:8585/api
    authProvider: openmetadata
    securityConfig:
      jwtToken: jwt_token
```
