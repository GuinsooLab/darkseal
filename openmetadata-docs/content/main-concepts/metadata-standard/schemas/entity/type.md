*This schema defines a type as an entity. Types includes property types and entity types. Custom types can also be defined by the users to extend the metadata system.*

## Properties

- **`name`**: Unique name that identifies the type. Refer to *#/definitions/typeName*.
- **`fullyQualifiedName`**: FullyQualifiedName same as `name`. Refer to *../type/basic.json#/definitions/fullyQualifiedEntityName*.
