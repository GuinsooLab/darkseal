# Webhooks

In 0.13.1 , webhooks have been deprecated. You should instead use [OpenMetadata alerts](/openmetadata/alerts-notifications)

Before upgrading to 0.13.1 it is recommended to save the existing Webhook configs(like webhook url) to use them later.

We have added Alerts/Notifications , which can be configured to receive customised alerts on updates in OM using Triggers, Filtering Information to different destinations like Slack, MsTeams or even Emails.
Please use the same webhook config that you had saved from previous version to configure the Alerts Destination after upgrading.

# Webhooks

A webhook is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information.
A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately.
OpenMetadata provides out-of-the-box support for webhooks.
OpenMetadata also allows the user to customise the webhook with a wide range of filters to listen to only selected type of events.


## OpenMetadata supports 3 webhook types:
1. **Generic**
2. **Slack**
3. **Microsoft Teams**

## How to Set up Generic Type Webhook:
1. **Name**: Add the name of the webhook
2. **Description**: Describe the webhook.
3. **Endpoint URL**: Enter the Consumer/client URL to consume the event's data.
4. **Activity Filter**: Can be used to activate or disable the webhook.
5. **Event Filters**: Filters are provided for all the entities and for all the events.
   Event data for specific action can be achieved.
6. **Batch Size**: Enter the batch size.
7. **Connection Timeout**: Enter the desired connection timeout.
8. **Secret Key**: Secret key can be used to secure the webhook connection.
