# OpenMetadata Server
Learn how to run the OpenMetadata server in development mode by using Docker and IntelliJ.

## Prerequisites
- Make sure you have a local instance of MySQL and ElasticSearch.
  - For an easy install of MySQL and ES, just install Docker on your local machine and run the following commands from the top-level directory

```shell
docker compose -f docker/local-metadata/docker-compose.yml up mysql elasticsearch --build -d
```

- For an easy install of PostgreSQL and ES, just install Docker on your local machine and run the following commands from the top-level directory

```shell
docker compose -f docker/local-metadata/docker-compose-postgres.yml up postgresql elasticsearch --build -d
```

- Bootstrap MySQL with tables
  1. Create a distribution as explained [here](/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/openmetadata-server#create-a-distribution-packaging) 
  2. Extract the distribution tar.gz file and run the following command

```shell
cd open-metadata-<version>/bootstrap
sh bootstrap_storage.sh drop-create-all
```

- Bootstrap ES with indexes and load sample data into MySQL
  1. Run OpenMetadata service instances through IntelliJ IDEA following the instructions [here](/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/openmetadata-server#run-instance-through-intellij-idea)
  2. Once the logs indicate that the instance is up, run the following commands from the top-level directory

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
make install_dev generate
cd ingestion
pip install -e '.[sample-data, elasticsearch]'
metadata ingest -c ./pipelines/sample_data.json
metadata ingest -c ./pipelines/sample_usage.json
metadata ingest -c ./pipelines/metadata_to_es.json
```

- You are now ready to explore the app by going to [http://localhost:8585](http://localhost:8585) *If the web page doesn't work as intended, please take a look at the troubleshooting steps [here](/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/openmetadata-server#troubleshooting)

## Building
The following commands must be run from the top-level directory.

```shell
mvn clean install
```

If you wish to skip the unit tests you can do this by adding `-DskipTests` to the command line.

## Create a distribution (packaging)
You can create a distribution as follows.

```shell
$ mvn clean install
```

The binaries will be created at:

```shell
openmetadata-dist/target/open-metadata-<version>.pom
openmetadata-dist/target/open-metadata-<version>.tar.gz
```

## Run instance through IntelliJ IDEA
Add a new Run/Debug configuration like the below screenshot.

1. Click on Intellij - Run menu
2. Click on "Edit Configurations"
3. Click + sign and Select Application and make sure your config looks similar to the below image

## Add missing dependency
Right-click on openmetadata-service

<Image src="/images/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/intellij-openmetadata-service.png" alt="Open project" caption=" "/>

Click on "Open Module Settings"

<Image src="/images/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/intellij-open-settings.png" alt="Open Module Settings" caption=" "/>

Go to "Dependencies"

<Image src="/images/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/intellij-dependencies.png" alt="Go to dependencies" caption=" "/>

Click “+” at the bottom of the dialog box and click "Add"

<Image src="/images/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/intellij-add-dependencies.png" alt="Add dependency" caption=" "/>

Click on Library

<Image src="/images/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/intellij-library.png" alt="Click on Library" caption=" "/>

In that list look for "jersey-client:2.25.1"

<Image src="/images/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/intellij-jersey-dependency.png" alt="Add jersey-client dependency" caption=" "/>

Select it and click "OK". 

We also need to set the folder ‘generated-resources’ in some module’s target folder as “source” folder. IntelliJ IDEA mark target folder as "excluded" by default, we could change it in the module setting. The openmetadata-spec and openmetadata-java-client modules have generated code, need to be changed.

Now run/debug the application.

## Troubleshooting
- If you see blank page at [http://localhost:8585](http://localhost:8585), please check the logs at logs/openmetadata.log. You might be encountering one of the following errors:
  - `connection refused` or `unreachable` - please confirm that MySQL and ES are reachable outside of docker by running `docker ps` and checking that ports 3306 and 9200 are listening on 0.0.0.0
    - If ElasticSearch in Docker on Mac is crashing, try changing Preferences -> Resources -> Memory to 4GB
    - If ElasticSearch logs show `high disk watermark [90%] exceeded`, try changing Preferences -> Resources -> Disk Image Size to at least 16GB
  - `Public Key Retrieval is not allowed` - verify that the JDBC connect URL in `conf/openmetadata.yaml` is configured with the parameter `allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true `
  - Browser console shows javascript errors, try doing a [clean build](/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/openmetadata-server#create-a-distribution-packaging). Some npm packages may not have been built properly.

## Coding Style
1. Configure IntelliJ to disable the [wild-card imports]
([https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-optimizing-imports.html#disable-wildcard-imports](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-optimizing-imports.html#disable-wildcard-imports))
