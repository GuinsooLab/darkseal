# Edit Data Lineage Manually

Edit lineage to provide a richer understanding of the provenance of data. The OpenMetadata no-code editor provides a drag and drop interface. Drop tables, pipelines, and dashboards onto the lineage graph. You may add new edges or delete existing edges to better represent data lineage.
