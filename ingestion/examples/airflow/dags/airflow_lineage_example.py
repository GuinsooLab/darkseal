OpenMetadata Airflow Lineage Backend example. Airflow provides a pluggable lineage backend that can
read a DAG's configured inlets and outlets to compose a lineage. With OpenMetadata we have a airflow lineage backend
to get all of the workflows in Airflow and also any lineage user's configured.
Please refer to https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/pipeline/airflow/lineage-backend on how to configure the lineage backend
with Airflow Scheduler
This is an example to demonstrate on how to configure a Airflow DAG's inlets and outlets
